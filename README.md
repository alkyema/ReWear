A sustainable fashion initiative by **Team Cyberpunk** to reduce textile waste and promote mindful clothing practices through a user-friendly, web-based platform that enables clothing swaps and point-based redemptions.

## 🌿 Overview

**ReWear** is a web platform that allows users to **exchange unused clothes** with others in their community or **redeem items using points** earned through contributions. By encouraging reuse and responsible fashion, ReWear aims to reduce environmental impact and foster a culture of sharing.
